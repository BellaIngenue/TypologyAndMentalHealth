## Documentation
### Overview of this Research Project
 
**Research Question**
When it comes to Typology and the limited research associated, what is the possible connection between Mental Disorders and the 16 MBTI types? Link the two via Country analysis.

**Hypothesis**
*Our hypothesis is that Mental Health and Typology have some slight connection and causation. By that we ask if there is a correlation between Mental Health disorders and Typology types such as the Enneagram and MBTI. We acknowledge that there may be some confounding variable such as Socioeconomic Status, Education, and Physical Health Status. There is also the reality that there is no strong connection between Psuedosciences and a lack of knowledge and evidentiary support.*

### Ethics and Privacy
**Do we have permisssion to use this data?**
As all of the data we have collected is open to the public for fair use, we have permission to use this data and for this purpose. All of our datasets for our variables are from Kaggle, Figshare, and Google Data.

**Are there privacy concerns regarding your datasets that you need to deal with, and/or terms of use that you need to comply with?**
All of the data compiled and used for our project was collected from different MBTI/Enneagram/Typology and Mental Health resources, studies, and websites. We are looking for this data through websites such as Kaggle or Figshare and through government websites that provide open-source, free use datasets, so we expect that we shouldn't run into too many complications with privacy, as much of the data has already been released to adhere to data privacy laws.

**Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis?**
There is a high probability that there would be some significant biases. Due to the idea and fact that Typology in general is known as a Pseduoscience, makes it apparent that it can be hard to correlate and causate between a hard science (such as Psychology) and something like Typology.

**What will we be doing with this data?**
We do not intend to ever use this project for monetary use, this is strictly for educational purposes only.
